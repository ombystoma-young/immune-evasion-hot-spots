The three components typically are encoded by consecutive genes. DnaJ homologs occur in many genomes, typically not near DnaK and GrpE-like genes; most such genes are not included by this family. Eukaryotic (mitochondrial and chloroplast) forms are not included in the scope of this family.

The best-studied members of this diverse superfamily include Human topoisomerase I, the bacteriophage lambda integrase, the bacteriophage P1 Cre recombinase, the yeast Flp recombinase, and the bacterial XerD/C recombinases. Their overall reaction mechanism is essentially identical and involves cleavage of a single strand of a DNA duplex by nucleophilic attack of a conserved tyrosine to give a 3' phosphotyrosyl protein-DNA adduct. In the second rejoining step, a terminal 5' hydroxyl attacks the covalent adduct to release the enzyme and generate duplex DNA. The enzymes differ in that topoisomerases cleave and then rejoin the same 5' and 3' termini, whereas a site-specific recombinase transfers a 5' hydroxyl generated by recombinase cleavage to a new 3' phosphate partner located in a different duplex region. Many DNA breaking-rejoining enzymes also have N-terminal domains, which show little sequence or structure similarity.

One of these, however, is a modular polyketide synthase 4800 amino acids in length from Streptomyces avermilitis in which this domain is the C-terminal segment. By contrast, the FkbH protein from Streptomyces hygroscopicus aparently contains only this domain. The remaining members of the family all contain an additional N-terminal domain of between 200 and 275 amino acids which show less than 20% identity to one another. It seems likely then that these proteins are involved in disparate functions, probably the biosynthesis of different natural products. For instance, the FkbH gene is found in a gene cluster believed to be responsible for the biosynthesis of unususal "PKS extender units" in the ascomycin pathway. This domain is composed of two parts, the first of which is a member of subfamily IIIC (TIGR01681) of the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily of aspartate-nucleophile hydrolases. All of the characterized enzymes within subfamily III are phosphatases, and all of the active site residues characteristic of HAD-superfamily phosphatases are present in this domain. The C-terminal portion of this domain is unique to this family (by BLAST).

In prokaryotes the complex consists of three proteins, SMC, ScpA (kleisin) and ScpB. ScpB dimerizes and binds to ScpA. As originally predicted, ScpB is structurally a winged-helix at both its N- and C-terminal halves. IN Bacillus subtilis,one Smc dimer is bridged by a single ScpAB to generate asymmetric tripartite rings analogous to eukaryotic SMC complex ring-shaped assemblies.

This family includes ATP-dependent DNA and RNA ligases. DNA ligases play a vital role in the diverse processes of DNA replication, recombination and repair. ATP-dependent DNA ligases have a highly modular architecture, consisting of a unique arrangement of two or more discrete domains, including a DNA-binding domain, an adenylation or nucleotidyltransferase (NTase) domain, and an oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding (OB)-fold domain. The adenylation domain binds ATP and contains many active site residues. Together with the C-terminal OB-fold domain, it comprises a catalytic core unit that is common to most members of the ATP-dependent DNA ligase family. The catalytic core contains six conserved sequence motifs (I, III, IIIa, IV, V and VI) that define this family of related nucleotidyltransferases including eukaryotic GRP-dependent mRNA-capping enzymes. The catalytic core contains both the active site as well as many DNA-binding residues. The RNA circularization protein from archaea and bacteria contains the minimal catalytic unit, the adenylation domain, but does not contain an OB-fold domain. This family also includes the m3G-cap binding domain of snurportin, a nuclear import adaptor that binds m3G-capped spliceosomal U small nucleoproteins (snRNPs), but doesn't have enzymatic activity.

Functions include DNA repair, DNA replication, and DNA recombination (or any process requiring ligation of two single-stranded DNA sections).

It occurs as part of a four-gene system with an exonuclease, a helicase and a phosphoesterase, with all four genes clustered or at least the first two and last two paired. This family resembles DNA ligase I (see TIGR00574 and pfam01068), and its presumed function may be in DNA repair, replication, or recombination.
