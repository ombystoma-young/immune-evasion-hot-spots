There are two conserved sequence motifs: VSR and YGA. This domain is the C terminal domain of the bacteriophage protein endosialidase. The endosialidase protein forms homotrimeric molecules and this domain complexes into a tail-spike stalk. The stalk region folds in a triple beta-helix that is interrupted by a small triple beta-prism domain. The tail-spike is a multifunctional protein device used by the phage to fulfill the following functions: (i) to adsorb to the bacterial polySia capsule (ii) to de-polymerize the capsule to gain access to the outer bacterial membrane, and finally (iii) to mediate tight adhesion to the membrane, a prerequisite for the initiation of the infection cycle.

This domain acts as a molecular chaperone; during virus particle assembly, the CIMCD of phage tailspike proteins induces the homo-trimerization of phage tailspike proteins by chaperoning the formation of a triple beta-helix. Homo-trimeric phage tailspike proteins are then auto-cleaved by the CIMCD domain. This family also includes the peptidase S74 Intramolecular Chaperone Auto-processing (ICA) domain of mammalian Myrf. The ICA domain drives the homo-oligomerization of Myrf in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. The homo-oligomeric Myrf is proteolyzed by the ICA domain, releasing its N-terminal fragments from the ER membrane.

This domain is the highly conserved beta propeller of bacteriophage endosialidase which represents the catalytically active part of the enzymes. This core domain forms stable SDS-resistant trimers. There is a nested beta barrel domain in this domain (pfam12195). The endosialidase protein complexes to form a homotrimeric molecule.

The best-studied members of this diverse superfamily include Human topoisomerase I, the bacteriophage lambda integrase, the bacteriophage P1 Cre recombinase, the yeast Flp recombinase, and the bacterial XerD/C recombinases. Their overall reaction mechanism is essentially identical and involves cleavage of a single strand of a DNA duplex by nucleophilic attack of a conserved tyrosine to give a 3' phosphotyrosyl protein-DNA adduct. In the second rejoining step, a terminal 5' hydroxyl attacks the covalent adduct to release the enzyme and generate duplex DNA. The enzymes differ in that topoisomerases cleave and then rejoin the same 5' and 3' termini, whereas a site-specific recombinase transfers a 5' hydroxyl generated by recombinase cleavage to a new 3' phosphate partner located in a different duplex region. Many DNA breaking-rejoining enzymes also have N-terminal domains, which show little sequence or structure similarity.

This domain has a role in interaction with regions of upstream promoter DNA and the nascent RNA chain, leading to the processivity of the enzyme. In order to make mRNA transcripts the RNA polymerase undergoes a transition from the initiation phase (which only makes short fragments of RNA) to an elongation phase. This domain undergoes a structural change in the transition from initiation to elongation phase. The structural change results in abolition of the promoter binding site, creation of a channel accommodating the heteroduplex in the active site and formation of an exit tunnel which the RNA transcript passes through after peeling off the heteroduplex.

This domain has a role in interaction with regions of upstream promoter DNA and the nascent RNA chain, leading to the processivity of the enzyme. In order to make mRNA transcripts the RNA polymerase undergoes a transition from the initiation phase (which only makes short fragments of RNA) to an elongation phase. This domain undergoes a structural change in the transition from initiation to elongation phase. The structural change results in abolition of the promoter binding site, creation of a channel accommodating the heteroduplex in the active site and formation of an exit tunnel which the RNA transcript passes through after peeling off the heteroduplex.

ATP-dependent DNA ligases have a highly modular architecture, consisting of a unique arrangement of two or more discrete domains, including a DNA-binding domain, an adenylation or nucleotidyltransferase (NTase) domain, and an oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding (OB)-fold domain. The adenylation domain binds ATP and contains many active site residues. Together with the C-terminal OB-fold domain, it comprises a catalytic core unit that is common to most members of the ATP-dependent DNA ligase family. The catalytic core contains six conserved sequence motifs (I, III, IIIa, IV, V and VI) that define this family of related nucleotidyltransferases including eukaryotic GRP-dependent mRNA-capping enzymes. The catalytic core contains both the active site as well as many DNA-binding residues. The RNA circularization protein from archaea and bacteria contains the minimal catalytic unit, the adenylation domain, but does not contain an OB-fold domain. This family also includes the m3G-cap binding domain of snurportin, a nuclear import adaptor that binds m3G-capped spliceosomal U small nucleoproteins (snRNPs), but doesn't have enzymatic activity.

The best-studied members of this diverse superfamily include Human topoisomerase I, the bacteriophage lambda integrase, the bacteriophage P1 Cre recombinase, the yeast Flp recombinase, and the bacterial XerD/C recombinases. Their overall reaction mechanism is essentially identical and involves cleavage of a single strand of a DNA duplex by nucleophilic attack of a conserved tyrosine to give a 3' phosphotyrosyl protein-DNA adduct. In the second rejoining step, a terminal 5' hydroxyl attacks the covalent adduct to release the enzyme and generate duplex DNA. The enzymes differ in that topoisomerases cleave and then rejoin the same 5' and 3' termini, whereas a site-specific recombinase transfers a 5' hydroxyl generated by recombinase cleavage to a new 3' phosphate partner located in a different duplex region. Many DNA breaking-rejoining enzymes also have N-terminal domains, which show little sequence or structure similarity.
